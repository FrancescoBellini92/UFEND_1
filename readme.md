## Udacity Front End ND project 1

First project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree: this project required building a static responsive website

This repo contains a sample blog website, with three sample pages:
 - home page, with a list of articles
 - article page, with a single article
 - subscribe page, for signin 

BEM methodoloy has been applied to promote DRY code and style encapsulation, and a mobile-first approach was followed to good cross-device user experience.

Project is deployed at https://francescobellini92.github.io/UFEND_1/
